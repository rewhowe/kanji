## Perl Scripts

This directory contains very rough data-processing perl scripts. These were used to generate the data required for this application, but are not regularly maintained and are not guaranteed to work under any environment (or at all).

Additionally, these were written shortly after learning perl so the formatting is a bit rough and the style may not make use of common perl conventions.
